    Prior to the signing step, our build will have generated two files (where x.y.z is the version number - eg 4.0.4):
      Brewtarget x.y.z Installer.exe
      Brewtarget x.y.z Installer.exe.sha256sum
    We want to create a signed version of the first file, and then generate a new checksum for it.

    Fortunately we don't have to work this out from scratch.  By manually uploading an installer to sign, SignPath will
    also generate a sample artifact-configuration, which we can then edit as needed.

    Because we are only signing a single installer, our configuration is actually very simple.

      This means do the signing with Microsoft Authenticode, which is "the primary signing method on the Windows
      platform".  This is equivalent to using Microsoftâ€™s SignTool.exe.
