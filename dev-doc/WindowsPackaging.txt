To distribute brewtarget, we need to add several files and folders to the main brewtarget directory from the Qt directory.

Qt\<version>\bin\[phonon4.dll,QtCore4.dll,QtGui4.dll,QtSvg4.dll,QtWebKit4.dll,QtXml4.dll]
Qt\<version>\plugins\[iconengines,imageformats,phonon_backend]

Also, depending, we may need the following:
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
mingwm10.dll

==MinGW 4.4.0 Bug==
In MinGW that comes with Qt, there is a bug http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2373234&group_id=2435&atid=102435
It causes the compiler to fail with: "error: '::swprintf' has not been declared"

Temporary fix:
Comment out "using ::swprintf", "using ::vfwprintf", and "using ::vswprintf" in C:\MinGW\lib\gcc\mingw32\4.4.0\include\c++\cwchar
