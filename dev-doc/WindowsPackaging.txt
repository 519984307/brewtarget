To distribute brewtarget, we need to add several files and folders to the main brewtarget directory from the Qt directory.

Qt\<version>\bin\[phonon4.dll,QtCore4.dll,QtGui4.dll,QtSvg4.dll,QtWebKit4.dll,QtXml4.dll]
Qt\<version>\plugins\[iconengines,imageformats,phonon_backend]

Also, depending, we may need the following:
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
mingwm10.dll
