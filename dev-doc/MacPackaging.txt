# Mac Bundle Packaging

Basic steps are:

    $ rm -r /Applications/brewtarget.app
    $ cmake -DDO_RELEASE_BUILD=ON -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64
    $ make

This makes /Applications/brewtarget.app

    $ make install

The following seems unnecessary. I tried to do it and the error message suggested the
frameworks had already been copied (and they had).

    $ make addframeworks

Most of the time, the SVG image format plugin will not automagically be
copied to the app. So, manually copy

    /Developer/Applications/Qt/plugins/imageformats/libqsvg.dylib
    /Developer/Applications/Qt/plugins/iconengines/libqsvgicon.dylib

to

    /Applications/brewtarget.app/Contents/PlugIns/imageformats/libqsvg.dylib
    /Applications/brewtarget.app/Contents/PlugIns/iconengines/libqsvgicon.dylib

If your Qt installation is not in the same place as mine, figure it out with

    $ qmake -query

Use the Apple "Disk Utility" to create a 100 MB disk image. Mount it and copy
brewtarget.app to it. Also, make a shortcut to /Applications and move it to the
mounted disk image as well. Eject the image, and use the Disk Utility to
convert the image to a compressed disk image.

From within OSX, scp the installer to the host machine to get it out.
