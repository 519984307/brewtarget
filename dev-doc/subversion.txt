==Merging Branches==
To merge a branch back to trunk/, do this:
$ cd trunk/
$ svn merge --reintegrate https://brewtarget.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/brewtarget/branches/thebranch
Fix any conflicts. "Mine" refers to the local working directory (the trunk), and "theirs"
refers to thebranch. When in doubt, probably choose tc (theirs conflict)  or tf (theirs full).
Make sure it builds and stuff. Fix any additional problems.
$ svn rm ../branches/thebranch
$ svn ci
