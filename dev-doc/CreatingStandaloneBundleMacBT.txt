Creating a stand-alone bundle for Mac Brewtarget with the QT libraries.
put together by Dan Cavanagh (dan@dancavanagh.com) with absolutely no guarantees :)

Prerequisites: 
1) you have QT installed on your system (if you build it yourself, please make sure to use the -universal flag when building, and build the dynamic library version, not the static version)
2) you can successfully build and run BrewTarget on your mac
3) you have an existing, working mac bundle of BrewTarget (just download the mac brewtarget app from Sourceforge and you'll get a working bundle)

Basic steps:

1) Build BrewTarget
2) Copy the BrewTarget executable into the bundle (goes into Contents>MacOS in the package, replace what's in there already)
	- to see the bundle contents, ctrl-click on the BrewTarget bundle and and choose "Show Package Contents"
3) In terminal, navigate to the directory containing the BrewTarget bundle.
4) Run "macdeployqt %.app" where % is the name of the brewtarget bundle (on my machine it was "brewtarget-1.2.4.app")

Here's where it may not work all the way. macdeployqt is a command-line tool that comes with the full QT package (or is built if you build QT yourself). It is supposed to copy the frameworks (basically a mac equivalent of .dll's) into the proper folder in the bundle, which is Contents>Frameworks. However, if it is unable to copy the frameworks you need, it will list which ones were unsuccessful, and their locations. You should view the list of failures and simply manually cp them into the Frameworks folder in the bundle.
