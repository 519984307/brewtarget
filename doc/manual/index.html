<h1>Brewtarget 1.1 Manual</h1>

<h2>A Walkthrough</h2>
<p>
I figure it's probably easier to demonstrate the features of the program rather than try to explain
every single concept. So, here we will create a nice American Amber Ale, trying to touch on as many
features as possible.
</p>

<h3>Making a New Recipe</h3>
<p>
Click on either File->"New Recipe", or click the green plus in the toolbar at the top of the main
window. Now, title your recipe in the box that pops up, and click "OK".
</p>

<h3>Making a New Equipment Record</h3>
<p>
Having an equipment record for your recipe is very important in Brewtarget. It contains a lot of
information about your <i>particular</i> setup, and helps Brewtarget better estimate your results.
Click on View->Equipments to bring up the Equipment Editor. At the bottom, press the green plus
and enter the name you wish to give it. Check "calculate pre-boil volume", and enter as many of
these fields as you can.

<ul>
   <li><b>Batch size</b> - How much wort you want to end up in the primary.</li>
   <li><b>Volume</b> - How much your mash tun can hold.</li>
   <li><b>Mass</b> - Mass of your mash tun.</li>
   <li><b>Specific heat</b> - Specific heat of the material of your mash tun in cal/(g*C). Typical values are:</li>
   
   <ul>
      <li>Aluminum - 0.215</li>
      <li>Copper - 0.0924</li>
      <li>Iron/Steel - 0.108</li>
      <li>Plastic - 0.359</li>
   </ul>
   
   <li><b>Boil time</b> - How long you usually boil.</li>
   <li><b>Evaporation Rate</b> - Every hour, your boil will lose (evap. rate)*(pre-boil vol.). Typically, around 15 percent.</li>
   <li><b>Kettle top-up water</b> - Amount of water you usually add directly to the kettle before boiling.</li>
   <li><b>Final top-up water</b> - Amount of water to add to the wort immediately before going into the primary.</li>
   <li><b>Hop utilization</b> - Don't use this. Brewtarget automatically calculates hop utilization.</li>
   <li><b>Kettle to fermenter</b> - How much wort you usually leave behind in the kettle when you transfer the wort to primary.</li>
   <li><b>Lauter deadspace</b> - How much wort you usually lose in the lauter tun.</li>
</ul>

Then, press the diskette button at the bottom to save.
</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipe Parameters</h3>
<p>
Now that you're back at the main window, open the Style drop-down list and choose "American Amber Ale".
From the Equipment drop-down list, choose "Ideal" (which assumes 5 gallon batches, 15% evaporation rate, and no losses)
which is already provided by Brewtarget, just for the sake of demonstration. For now, leave
the efficiency at 70% for the same reason.
</p>

<h3>Adding Ingredients</h3>
<p>
First, go to the Fermentables tab on the main window, and click the green plus sign on the right.
This brings up the database of fermentables that Brewtarget has. Scroll down to "Pale Malt (2 row) US",
single-click the name (or anywhere in the row) and press "Add to Recipe". Repeat for
"Caramel/Crystal Malt - 40L", and close the fermentable database window.
</p>
<p>
Back at the main window, you will see those two malts in your recipe. Click on the Crystal 40's "Mashed"
checkbox to tell it that we want to have this in the mash.
</p>
<p>
Here's a cool feature about Brewtarget: you can enter amounts of stuff in pretty much any units you want.
Let's see what I mean. Double-click the 2-row's "amount" cell and enter "3.175 kg". You will see that
it immediately gets converted into "7.000 lb". For the crystal 40, tell it "32 oz" and watch it get
converted into "2.000 lb". You can change english/metric preferences in Tools->Options.
</p>
<p>
Now you should notice something different about the OG, FG, etc., displayed in the main window.
The OG now reads 1.045, and it is green which indicates "to style" as dictated by the amber ale
style we chose. However, the FG is red, which means it's too high, and the ABV is blue which means
it is too low. The glass of beer to the right of that represents the approximate color of your beer,
and the thing right below that which reads "Cloying" is a maltiness indicator (based on OG vs. IBUs).
</p>
<p>
Now, go add 1 oz Cascade at 1 hr, 1 oz Cascade at 15 min, and 1 oz Cascade at 5 min. The IBUs should
be at 29, and in the green. Add Wyeast American Ale yeast to the recipe. Now everything should be in
the green except for the ABV which is at 4.4%, but that's ok (you can correct this if you want by
adding a little more fermentable stuff).
</p>

<h3>Making a Mash</h3>
<p>
Let's do a 2-step mash with a protein rest at 121 F and a conversion rest at 152 F. Go to the mash
tab and click the green plus. Name it "Protein" and click "OK". Double click its "Temp" cell and
change to "121 F", and change the "Time" to "20 min". Do the same for a "Conversion" step at "152 F"
and for "1 hr".
</p>
<p>
Click on "Edit Mash", give it a name, and set the initial grain temp to 70 F. Now, click on the
"Mash wiz" button, and tell it you want the mash thickness to be 2.7 (in L/kg. 2-4 is normal).
The mash wizard just did 3 things for you: calculated infusion volumes, infusion temps., and
gave you a sparge step that will make you hit your pre-boil volume. Pretty cool? You can
see any of the infusion temperatures by selecting the name of the mash step in the table and
pressing the edit button to the right (looks like a pencil and paper).
</p>

<h3>Brewday Mode</h3>
<p>
Now that your recipe is all planned, wouldn't it be good to have some instructions on your
brewday? Click the "Brewday mode" button in the toolbar at the top, and answer "yes". It
has made all instructions for you and listed them on the left in order. There is a timer
available for each step if you click "show timer", as well as a couple of timers at the
bottom for any purpose you want. They are in HH:MM:SS format, and the text box above each
one is what you use to set it. Just enter "1:00:00" and press "set" to set the timer for
1 hour, for example.
</p>
<p>
You can remove, shift up/down, insert, change steps as you see fit to help you be organized
on your brew day.
</p>

<h3>Saving your work</h3>
<p>
Before you close Brewtarget, be sure to press the diskette at the top in the toolbar,
<b>or you will lose any changes you have made in this session!</b>
</p>

<h2>General Concepts</h2>
<p>
Brewtarget maintains an internal BeerXML database of recipes, ingredients, etc. At program startup,
it reads these files into memory, and all the editing you do occurs in memory until such time that
you decide to press "save" on the main window. At this point, all your changes will be committed to
the BeerXML database on disk.
</p>

<h2>Adding Ingredients to a Recipe</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Choose the appropriate tab in the main window (Fermentable, Hops,...).</li>
	<li>Click the &quot;add&quot; button in the tab.</li>
	<li>Select any column of the row of the ingredient you wish to add.</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Add to Recipe&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Importing Recipes</h2>
<p>
You can import other BeerXML recipes (such as, from Beersmith) by using File->Import Recipes.
However, you need to be aware that Beersmith does not strictly adhere to XML standards or even
BeerXML, so you may have some trouble importing recipes from time to time. Brewtarget tries
to maintain strict compatability with both.
</p>

<h2>Exporting Recipes</h2>
<p>
I bet you can figure this one out.
</p>

<h2>Units</h2>
	<p>
	Brewtarget supports both metric and US customary units (sometimes incorrectly called English units or Imperial units).
	To switch between these modes, go to tools->options, and check/uncheck the appropriate box.
	It also supports a cool feature I call <b>auto-conversion</b>. For example, if you are in US mode, and you enter
	&quot;0.50 gal&quot; into a text field, it will appear as &quot;2.000 qt&quot;. You may also enter units from the other
	unit system if you like. However, if you enter an unsupported unit, Brewtarget will assume the quantity you entered
	has the same units as the BeerXML entry for that field (which is in metric). For example, if you enter &quot;20 asdf&quot;
	into a volume field while in US mode, you will see &quot;5.283 gal&quot; because Brewtarget assumed you meant &quot;20 L&quot;
	and then converted to US units.
	</p>
	<h3>Caveats with Auto-conversion</h3>
	<p>
	With US units, people have a tendency to sometimes put a trailing &quot;s&quot; or a period at the end (hrs, hrs., etc.).
	Brewtarget only supports singular no-period units. This will probably be a common error among users since the habit is
	so ingrained. The reason for this lack of support for such spellings should be obvious...it would mean the program has
	to guess what you mean. The units supported, and the exact unit abbreviation you should use are given below.
	</p>
