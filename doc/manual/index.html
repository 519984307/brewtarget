<a id="walkthrough"><h1>A Walkthrough</h1></a>
<p>
I figure it's probably easier to demonstrate the features of the program rather than try to explain
every single concept. So, here we will create a nice American Amber Ale, trying to touch on as many
features as possible.
</p>

<a id="settingoptions"><h2>Setting Options</h2></a>
<p>
Brewtarget's options are in Tools-&gt;Options. Here you should set your preferences for the unit
system you wish to use, and which formulae you want to use in creating your recipes. For the purposes
of this walkthrough, set the units to US traditional, temperature to Fahrenheit, gravity to specific gravity,
color to Morey, and IBU to Tinseth. 
</p>
<p class="critical"><strong>Note</strong>: if you choose Plato for gravity, then all the displayed FG
numbers are <kbd>not</kbd> corrected. So, the displayed FG reflects the actual FG: not what you will see if
you use your refractometer.
</p>

<a id="newequipment"><h2>Defining Your Equipment</h2></a>
<p>Never <kbd>ever</kbd> try to formulate a recipe without setting up an equipment record.
Having an equipment record for your recipe is very important in Brewtarget. It contains a lot of
information about your <i>particular</i> setup, and helps Brewtarget better estimate your results. </p>
<p> Click on View-&gt;Equipments to bring up the Equipment Editor, or go to the
equipment tree, right click and select "New Equipment". At the bottom, press
the green plus and enter the name you wish to give it. Check &quot;calculate
pre-boil volume&quot;, and enter as many of these fields as you can. When
done, press the diskette button at the bottom of the dialog to save.

</p>

<a id="newrecipe"><h3>Making a New Recipe</h3></a>
<p>
Click on either File-&gt;&quot;New Recipe&quot;, click the blue plus in the
toolbar at the top of the main window or right-click in the recipe tab of the
tree and select &quot;New Recipe&quot;. Name your recipe in the box that
pops up, and click &quot;OK&quot;.
</p>

<a id="adjustingrecipe"><h2>Adjusting Recipe Parameters</h2></a>
<p> 
If you created your equipment profile as shown above, and you made it the
default profile, you won't need to do anything else.
</p>

<p> 
Otherwise, choose the equipment profile you set up in the <a
href="#newequipment">New Equipment</a> section from the Equipment drop-down
list.  You can also drag it from the tree on the left and drop it on the
recipe. After selecting or dropping the equipment, you will be asked if you
want to set the batch and boil size of the recipe to that of the equipment.
Click &quot;Yes&quot;.
</p>

<a id="setstyles"><h2>Selecting the Style</h2></a>
<p>
Brewtarget comes pre-loaded with all of the BJCP styles. This means you can
check your recipe against the guidelines for the particular style you are
trying to make. To do this, select &quot; American Amber Ale&quot; from the
Style drop down list. You will notice that the numbers flanking the
OG, FG, ABV, Bitterness, and Color fields have changed. These blue and red numbers
reflect the lower and upper bounds of these parameters for the style. The
middle number for each row is the current estimate for your recipe. If the
number is blue, it means it is too low; red means too high, and green means
in range for the style. If you choose, you can create your own styles
in the View-&gt;Styles dialog. You can also view descriptions of the
particular style and recommended ingredients there.
</p>

<a id="addingingredients"><h2>Adding Ingredients</h2></a>
<p>
Open the &quot;Fermentable&quot; tree in the left pane (denoted with a barley icon),
and drag'n'drop the &quot;Pale Malt (2 row) US&quot;, &quot;Caramel/Crystal Malt - 80L&quot; onto the recipe pane.
<p>
Back at the main window, you will see those two malts in your recipe. Click on the Crystal 80's &quot;Mashed&quot;
checkbox to tell it that we want to have this in the mash (this malt can also be simply steeped).
</p>
<p>
<h3>Units</h3>
Here's a cool feature about Brewtarget: you can enter amounts of stuff in
pretty much any units you want.  Let's see what I mean. Double-click the
2-row's &quot;amount&quot; cell and enter &quot;4.536 kg&quot;. You will see
that it immediately gets converted into &quot;10.000 lb&quot; if you're using
US units. For the Crystal 80, tell it &quot;32 oz&quot; and watch it get
converted into &quot;2.000 lb&quot;. You can change US/English/SI preferences
in Tools-&gt;Options. Please see <a href="#supportunits">Supported Units</a>
in this document to see the correct abbreviation for each unit.
<p>
<h3>Controlling units</h3>
You can control this feature for each of the main tables and fields in the
display. For example, lets say you use a refractometer to measure your SG and
OG, but you use a hydrometer to measure the FG. In the options, select
&quot;Brix/Plato&quot; as the system default. In the main window, right
click on the &quot;FG&quot; label and select &quot;Specific Gravity&quot; OG and SG will still be
shown in Brix, but the FG will now display in specific gravity.
</p>
<p>
This feature works on all of the fields in the main window and on brewnotes by
right-clicking on the label for the field. It works on the fermentables, hops,
miscellaneous, yeast and mash tables by right-clicking on the header for the
column. It works for any field for which it makes sense. For example, you can
specify the units for amount, infusion temp and target temp on the mash table
but not for the time. Additionally, this feature may not be fully implemented
in all of the tables, editors and tools. 
</p>
<p>
<h3>Controlling scale</h3>
Additionally, you can control the scaling where it makes sense. For example,
assume you always want your fermentables in the table to displayed in grams.
Right click on the &quot;Amount&quot; column in the table. Select &quot;Default&quot; if your
system default is SI, or select SI. Then click on the &quot;Scale&quot; submenu and you
can select &quot;Default&quot; &quot;Milligrams&quot; &quot;Grams&quot; or
&quot;Kilograms&quot; Selecting the first option will give you the default
brewtarget behavior. The other three choices will force
brewtarget to automatically scale the weights appropriately.
</p>
<p class="important"><strong>Important</strong>: do not forget that you SHOULD
enter the unit suffix (lb, kg, L, mL, etc.) for the amount boxes in
brewtarget. If you do not, brewtarget will try to guess what you mean based on
your defaults and what field you are editting. The guessing is pretty good,
but you should not rely on it. In this case, brewtarget will assume that
fermentables are entered in either lbs or kg, depending on the default units
you have chosen. 
</p>
<p>
Now you should notice something different about the OG, FG, etc., displayed in
the main window.  The OG now reads 1.052, and it is green which indicates
&quot;to style&quot; as dictated by the amber ale style we chose. However, the
FG is red, which means it's too high, the ABV is blue which means it is too
low, and the Color number is green: just right. The glass of beer to the right
represents the approximate color of your beer, and the thing right below that
which reads &quot;Cloying&quot; is the maltiness indicator (based on IBU/GU
ratio which now shows 0).  You shouldn't take the maltiness indicator too
seriously; it is just a general guide.
</p>
<p>
Now, go to the Hops tab and add 1 oz Cascade at 1 hr, 1 oz Cascade at 15 min, and 1 oz Cascade at 5 min. The IBUs should
be about 32.4, and in the green. Add WLP001 yeast to the recipe. Now everything should be in
the green.
</p>

<a id="makemash"><h2>Making a Mash</h2></a>
<p>
Let's do a 2-step mash with a protein rest at 121 F and a conversion rest at 152 F.
</p>
<p class="important">
<strong>Aside:</strong> I should mention something here. Until now, Brewtarget has been
<kbd>lying</kbd> to you. Underneath the target batch size on the main window, it
says your calculated batch size and the calculated boil size are not 0. These
are estimates based on your equipment profile. Brewtarget is lying because
it's convenient just to be able to start adding the ingredients and get an
approximate answer. After setting the mash addition volumes, you will get a
real answer.
</p>
<p>
Click on &quot;Edit Mash&quot; and give it a name. Notice that you can enter the initial grain temp, sparge
temp and initial tun temp here. Entering these as accurately as possible will give you the best chance
to nail your temperatures. To set tun mass and specific heat, you should click &quot;From Equipment&quot;.
You can save this mash profile by pressing &quot;Save Mash&quot; at the bottom of the mash tab. It
will be saved under the name you gave it in the &quot;Edit mash&quot; dialog. You can
recall a mash profile by selecting it in the appropriate drop down box.
From here, there are two ways to create the mash.
</p>

<a id="mashwiz"><h3>Method 1: Mash wiz</h3></a>
<p>
Go to the mash tab and click the blue plus. Name it &quot;Protein&quot; and
click &quot;OK&quot;. Double click its &quot;Target Temp&quot; cell and change
to &quot;121 F&quot;, and change the &quot;Time&quot; to &quot;20 min&quot;.
This means we want to hit a target temperature of 121 F for 20 minutes. Do the
same for a &quot;Conversion&quot; step at &quot;152 F&quot; for &quot;1
hr&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The mash wiz is for quickly and easily getting the correct mash temperatures
and volumes for a single batch sparge mash.  Click on the &quot;Mash wiz&quot;
button, and give it a mash thickness of 1.25 qt/lb.  The mash wizard just did
3 things for you: calculated infusion volumes, infusion temps, and gave you a
sparge step that will make you hit your pre-boil volume. <b>NOTE</b>: you
don't have to actually sparge with all of the sparge water, but can put a
portion directly into the kettle depending on how you like to sparge. 
</p>
<p>
Now Brewtarget is not lying anymore about the calculated boil volume and batch
size. You can see any of the infusion temperatures under the &quot;Infusion
Temp&quot; column.  
<p class="important">Since your equipment and recipe might change, you should
always do the mash wizard after recalling a saved mash profile.
</p>

<a id="mashdesigner"><h3>Method 2: Mash designer</h3></a>
<p>
The mash designer is for more advanced users. It can be used to create pretty much any mash schedule
you desire with however many sparges, and at whatever infusion temp or volume you desire. To enter it,
just click the &quot;Mash Des&quot; button. It is not necessary to add all of the steps beforehand
as we did with the mash wiz. A dialog will ask you for the temperature of the
tun before the first infusion, so enter 70 F and continue.
</p>
<p>
We are now looking at the parameters for the first infusion. Enter &quot;Protein&quot; for the name,
leave the type at &quot;Infusion&quot;, enter &quot;121 F&quot; for &quot;Target temp.&quot;, and
&quot;20 min&quot; for the time. Now, you can either move the infusion/decoction amount slider OR
the infusion temp slider. Moving one will cause the other to move so that the combination of
amount and infusion temp causes you to hit 121 F. The upper and lower limits of these sliders
are based on the maximum available space left in the tun (as given by the current equipment), and
the boiling temperature of water. Start the amount slider at the far left. You will see that the
tun fullness meter on the right shows an infusion ratio of 0.11 qt/lb which is far too low. How
do I know it's too low? The total collected wort meter shows a negative value, meaning that the grain
will absorb all of the infusion's water and could absorb more. So, slowly move the amount
slider until the infusion ratio reaches about 1.25 qt/lb.
</p>
<p>
You should see that the tun is about half full, and we have reached 1.9 gal of the 6.25 gal that we
plan to collect pre-boil. Click &quot;Next&quot;. Title this step &quot;Conversion&quot; and set the
target temp to 152 F and the time to 1 hr. Slowly move the temp slider all the way to 212 F. Click
&quot;Next&quot;. Entitle this step &quot;Batch Sparge&quot;. Click the &quot;Batch Sparge&quot;
checkbox, set the target temp to 165 F, and the time to 15 min. You will notice that the tun fullness
has gone down, simulating that you have drained the tun of liquid; this is the purpose of the checkbox.
Move the amount slider slowly to the right until the total collected wort reaches about 6.25 gal.
<p class="important">If you exceed the target collected wort volume, the progress bar will still show 100 percent, so be
careful and pay attention to the text which shows the actual collected wort. Click &quot;Finish&quot;
to return to the main window.
</p>

<a id="brewdaymode"><h2>Brewday Mode</h2></a>
<p>
Now that your recipe is all planned, wouldn't it be good to have some instructions on your
brewday? Click the &quot;Brewday&quot; tab at the top of the main window. Click &quot;Generate Instructions&quot;.
It has made all instructions for you and listed them on the left in order.
You can remove, shift up/down, insert, change steps as you see fit to help you be organized
on your brew day.
</p>
<p>
There are 3 timers to help you with
time-critical steps if you click the clock button in the toolbar of the main window.
They are in HH:MM:SS format, and the text box above each
one is what you use to set it. Just enter &quot;1:00:00&quot; and press &quot;set&quot; to set the timer for
1 hour, for example. The &quot;Sound&quot; button allows you to select a sound that will be played when
the timer reaches zero. Brewtarget has provided many default sounds to choose from, or you can
select any other sound file on your computer.
</p>

<a id="printrecipe"><h2>Printing the Recipe</h2></a>
<p>
Print and print preview are available under the &quot;File&quot; menu. There are two printouts
available. One is &quot;Recipe&quot; and the other is &quot;Brewday&quot;. The recipe printout is
all the info related to the recipe you have made. The brewday printout is formatted in organized
specifically for following when you brew.
</p>

<a id="savework"><h2>Saving Your Work</h2></a>
<p>
When you close brewtarget, you will be given an option to either save or
discard your work.
</p>

<a id="generalconcepts"><h1>General Concepts</h1></a>
<p>
Brewtarget v2.0 uses an SQLite database of recipes, ingredients, etc.
If brewtarget should crash unexpectedly, you will be prompted to either
restore the changes made last session or rollback the database to discard
the changes in the last session.
</p>

<a id="trees"><h2>Trees</h2></a>
<p>
The application window is split into three major panes: the trees, the recipe
and the ingredients. The tree pane is a set of tabs that displays your
recipes, equipment profiles, fermentables, hops, miscellaneous items and hops.
You can sort any of the trees on the displayed fields.

Double clicking on any item in the tree will open up the
appropriate editor for that item. For recipes, it will open the
recipe in the main window.
</p>

There are 6 tabs:
<ul>
   <li>Recipes - this tree shows all your recipes.  You can drag'n'drop the
   recipe onto the main window and that recipe will be loaded. Each recipe
   will also show any associated brewnotes.</li>
   <li>Equipment - this shows all your defined kit. You can drag'n'drop a
   piece of equipment onto your recipe which will have the same effect as
   changing the equipment via the dropdown box. </li>
   <li>Fermentables, Hops, Misc and Yeast - these show all of your defined
   fermentables, hops, miscellaneous and yeasts, respectively. Dragging an
   item onto the main window will add that item to the recipe.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can right-click almost anywhere on a tree and get a menu of options.
Depending on where you click, the menus will change a bit. If you right-click
on a recipe, the first option will be "new recipe". If you right-click on a
fermentable, the first option will be "new fermentable". Otherwise, the
available options will be the same.
</p>
<p>
You can select multiple items, right-click and then perform an action on the
entire selected list. The only exception is the &quot;Export&quot; function.
Limitations in the BeerXML format makes it very difficult to export both recipes
and anything else at the same time.
</p>

<a id="brewnotes"><h2>BrewNotes</h2></a>
<p>
If you right-click a recipe, you can select an action called &quot;Brew
It!&quot;. If you select this action, a new entry will be created underneath
the recipe and a new tab will be opened in the main window. This new tab
allows you to record important information about your beer during its creation
(sg, volumes, temperatures, etc.). This allows the brewer to track
performance over time and adjust their equipment and efficiencies to better
predict what you brew.
</p>
<p class="important">If you want more fields available, open a feature request</p>

<p>
The values are preloaded based on the recipe as written. As you move through
your brewday, you can record the actual numbers. The calculated values in the
middle of the screen will change based on those inputs.  For example, if you
expected an SG of 1.036 but only got 1.032 the projected OG, ABV and ABV will
all change to reflect the lower SG.
</p>

<p>
There are four main sections on the brewnote tab.

<a id="ingredtorecipe"><h2>Adding Ingredients to a Recipe</h2></a>
<a id="ingrededitors"><h3>Method 1: Editors</h3></a>
If you are looking for a fermentable with a specific SRM or a yeast from a
specific lab, this approach allows you to sort on any column you want.
<ol>
	<li>Choose the appropriate tab in the main window (Fermentable, Hops,...).</li>
	<li>Click the &quot;add&quot; button in the tab.</li>
	<li>Select any column of the row of the ingredient you wish to add.</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Add to Recipe&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<a id="ingreddrag"><h3>Method 2: Drag'n'Drop</h3></a>
This is the lazy way of doing it, as long as you don't mind the default sort
order.
<ol>
   <li> Open the appropriate tree in the left pane. </li>
   <li> Click on the item you wish to add </li>
   <li> Drag it anywhere in the main part of the window </li>
   <li> And drop </li>
   <li> The tabs will change if required. E.g., if you drop a hop onto the
   &quot;Fermentables&quot; tab, the focus will change to the &quot;Hops&quot;
   tab. </li>
</ol>
<a id="importingrecipes"><h2>Importing Recipes</h2></a>
<p>
You can import other BeerXML recipes (such as, from Beersmith) by using File-&gt;Import Recipes.
However, you need to be aware that Beersmith does not strictly adhere to XML standards or even
BeerXML itself (!), so you may have some trouble importing recipes from time to time. Brewtarget tries
to maintain strict compatability with both.
</p>

<a id="exportingrecipes"><h2>Exporting Recipes</h2></a>
<p>
This option will export selected recipes to BeerXML.
</p>

<a id="backupandrestore"><h2>Backing Up and Restoring Databases</h2></a>
<p>
For many reasons, you may want to back up all your recipes and ingredients and everything. To do this,
go to File-&gt;&quot;Backup Database&quot; and select an empty directory. Restoring the database is
just as simple. However, be aware that when you restore a database, anything in your current one will
be wiped out.
</p>
<p class="important">As of Brewtarget v2.0, restoring a database will cause
brewtarget to automatically restart.
</p>

<a id="postingrecipe"><h2>Posting Your Recipe</h2></a>
Brewtarget offers two different methods for posting your recipes.
      
<a id="postclip"><h3>Method 1: Recipe to Clipboard</h3></a>
<p>
This tool is used to make a text version of the recipe so that you may post it online
or whatever else you can do with a text version. To get the text version, Tools-&gt;&quot;Recipe to Clipboard as Text&quot;,
then click paste in a text editor or other paste-able window.
</p>

<a id="posthtml"><h3>Method 2: Recipe to HTML</h3></a>
<p>
Another way you can share you recipes is to export them to HTML. Use
File-&gt;&quot;Recipe&quot;-&gt;&quot;Save to HTML&quot;. You can export
either the recipe or the brewday instructions.
</p>

<a id="tools"><h2>Tools</h2></a>
Brewtarget offers a lot of tools to aid the brewer in writing recipes and on
the brew day itself.

<a id="ogcorrection"><h3>OG Correction</h3></a>
<p>
A common problem is that you under or over estimate your efficiency and get a different OG than you
planned for. To correct this in the boil, choose Tools-&gt;&quot;OG Correction Help&quot;. Please note
that this tool makes the assumption that you are not going to add any water post boil.
Just enter the SG, temp of sample, and calibration temp of the hydrometer OR the degrees Plato of the wort
as you read it pre-boil. Then enter the pre-boil volume. Now, click &quot;Calculate&quot; and 3 fields
will populate on the output half of the window. The first shows you the post-boil OG if you do nothing.
The next shows you how much water to add (or boil off if negative) in order to achieve the right OG.
The last shows how much wort you will end up with.
</p>

<a id="pitchrate"><h3>Pitch Rate Calculator</h3></a>
<p>
This tool is located in Tools-&gt;&quot;Pitch Rate Calculator&quot; and helps you to make a starter
that has the correct amount of yeast for your beer. Put in the wort volume, OG and starter OG (in specific gravity)
and select the pitch rate. The pitch rate should be 0.75-1.00 for most ales and 1.50-2.00 for lagers.
The output is the number of yeast cells required (in billions), the number of wyeast activator packs or
white labs vials needed without a starter, the amount of dry yeast required (without starter), and the
size of the starter needed to reach the cell count at the given starter OG (usually never over 1.030).
</p>

<a id="primingcalc"><h3>Priming Calculator</h3></a>
<p>
Tools-&gt;&quot;Priming Calculator&quot;. Put in the required input values, select a priming agent, and
press calculate.
</p>

<a id="refractometer"><h3>Refractometer</h3></a>
<p>
Tools-&gt;&quot;Refractometer Tools&quot;. Here, you can find OG and current SG by using refractometer
readings. You must always enter the current plato and either the original plato OR the OG. If you just
want to find out what 11.2 Plato corresponds to, enter 11.2 in both the original plato and current plato
fields.
</p>

<a id="units"><h2>Units</h2></a>
	<p>
	Brewtarget supports SI, Imperial, and US customary units.
	To switch between these modes, go to Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Units, and check/uncheck the appropriate box.
	It also supports <b>auto-conversion</b>. For example, if you are in US mode, and you enter
	&quot;0.50 gal&quot; into a text field, it will appear as &quot;2.000 qt&quot;. You may also enter units from the other
	unit system if you like. However, if you enter an unsupported unit, Brewtarget will assume the quantity you entered
	has the same units as the BeerXML entry for that field (which is usuall SI). For example, if you enter &quot;20 asdf&quot;
	into a volume field while in US mode, you will see &quot;5.283 gal&quot; because Brewtarget assumed you meant &quot;20 L&quot;
	and then converted to US units. In other words, always use a valid unit suffix.
   </p>
   <a id="unitsandscale"><h3>Controlling unit and scale</h3></a>
   <p>
   A new feature to Brewtarget v2.0 is the ability to control what units are
   used in the display and how they scale. In any field where it makes sense
   (volumes, weights, temperatures and gravities), you can right-click the
   associated label and be presented with the unit and scale menu.
   </p>
   <p>
   Volumes will present you with the options &quot;default&quot;,
   &quot;SI&quot;, &quot;US Customary&quot; and &quot;British Imperial&quot;;
   weights will present you with the options &quot;default&quot;,
   &quot;SI&quot; and &quot;US Customary&quot;; temperatures will present the
   options &quot;default&quot;, &quot;Celsius&quot; and
   &quot;Fahrenheit&quot;; gravities will show &quot;default&quot;,
   &quot;Plato&quot; and &quot;Specific Gravity&quot;.
   </p>
   <p>
   Selecting one of those options will cause that field to be displayed in the
   selected unit. So you can, for example, display Boil SG and OG in Plato,
   but FG in specific gravity.
   </p>
   <p>
   You can also select the <i>scale</i> for any volume or weight field.
   You can use this to, for example, cause your target batch size to be displayed in
   quarts instead of gallons.
   </p>
   <p>
   You can do the same thing in any of the ingredient tabs by right clicking
   on the column header. This will allow you to display your hops in grams,
   but keep your fermentables displayed in pounds.
   </p>


   <a id="caveats"><h3>Caveats with Auto-conversion</h3></a>
	<p>
	With US and Imperial units, people have a tendency to sometimes put a trailing &quot;s&quot; or a period at the end (hrs, hrs., etc.).
	Brewtarget only supports singular no-period units to be consistent with the metric system. This is a common error among users since the habit is
	so ingrained. The units supported, and the exact unit abbreviation you should use are given below.
	</p>
   <a id="supportunits"><h3>Supported Units</h3></a>
   <h4>US Customary and British Imperial Units</h4>
   <p class="important"> The abbreviations are the same as for US Customary and British Imperial units, but they denote the
   appropriate quantity in each system.

   <a id="newin2"><h1>New in this release</h1></a>
   Brewtarget v2.0 has been long in the making, mostly because we have done a
   massive reworking of the internals. 
   <a id="newdatabase"><h2>SQLite DB</h2></a>
   <p>
   We have replaced the old XML files with a brand new SQLite database. 
   We have spent a long time making this as transparent as possible. If we
   have done our jobs well, the only thing most users should notice is
   brewtarget seems to load faster and is a bit faster in other places.
   </p>
   <p>
   We will be using this change to implement inventory, multi-level undo,
   automatic versioning of recipes, etc. We also hope to allow you to decide
   which database engine you want to use -- SQLite and mysql at least,
   postgresql likely. 
   </p>
   <a id="newunitandscales"><h2>Units and Scales</h2></a>
   <p>
   This has been a very requested feature that has taken us a long time to
   implement correctly. You can now override the default unit (e.g., US
   Customary) per field, and you can control the scale (so your hops are
   always displayed in grams, no matter how many kilos you are adding).
   </p>
   <a id="newtrees"><h2>Tree Views</h2></a>
   <p>
   The trees continue to evolve. They are now split into their own separate
   tabs and can be sorted on the fields displayed. The next release will let
   you select which fields are displayed and hopefully allow you to define
   folders.
   </p>
   <a id="defaultequipment"><h2>Default Equipment</h2></a>
   <p>
   You can select one piece of equipment as the default and any new recipe
   will have that automatically defined as the equipment. You can do this by
   opening the equipment profile and selecting the "Set as default" option in
   the upper left.
   </p>
