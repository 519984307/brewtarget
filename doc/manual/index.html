<h1>Brewtarget 1.2.4 Manual</h1>

<h2>A Walkthrough</h2>
<p>
I figure it's probably easier to demonstrate the features of the program rather than try to explain
every single concept. So, here we will create a nice American Amber Ale, trying to touch on as many
features as possible.
</p>

<h3>Setting Options</h3>
<p>
Brewtarget's options are in Tools-&gt;Options. Here you should set your preferences for the unit
system you wish to use, and which formulae you want to use in creating your recipes. For the purposes
of this walkthrough, set the units to US traditional, temperature to Fahrenheit, gravity to specific gravity,
color to Morey, and IBU to Tinseth. Note: if you choose Plato for gravity, then all the displayed FG
numbers are <i>not</i> corrected. So, the displayed FG reflects the actual FG: not what you will see if
you use your refractometer.
</p>

<h3>Making a New Recipe</h3>
<p>
Click on either File-&gt;&quot;New Recipe&quot;, click the blue plus in the toolbar at the top of the main
window or right-click on the recipe part of the tree and select &quot;New Recipe&quot;. Now, title your recipe in the box that pops up, and click &quot;OK&quot;.
</p>

<h3>Making a New Equipment Record</h3>
<p>
Never <b>ever</b> try to formulate a recipe without setting up an equipment record.
Having an equipment record for your recipe is very important in Brewtarget. It contains a lot of
information about your <i>particular</i> setup, and helps Brewtarget better estimate your results.
Click on View-&gt;Equipments to bring up the Equipment Editor. At the bottom, press the green plus
and enter the name you wish to give it. Check &quot;calculate pre-boil volume&quot;, and enter as many of
these fields as you can.

<ul>
   <li><b>Name</b> - Any name you choose to title your equipment setup.</li>
   <li><b>Pre-boil volume</b> - Amount of wort in the kettle immediately prior to boil.</li>
   <li><b>Calculate pre-boil volume</b> - Based on the boil time, losses, and water additions, automatically
          calculate the pre-boil volume instead of entering it by hand.
   <li><b>Batch size</b> - How much wort you want to end up in the primary.</li>

   <li><b>Boil time</b> - How long you usually boil.</li>
   <li><b>Evaporation rate</b> - Every hour, your boil will lose this much water. Typically, around 3L or 0.75 US gallons.</li>
   <li><b>Kettle top-up water</b> - Amount of water you usually add directly to the kettle before boiling.
                                    For <b>extract recipes</b>, this should be equal to the boil volume.</li>
   <li><b>Final top-up water</b> - Amount of water to add to the wort immediately before going into the primary.</li>
   <li><b>Hop utilization</b> - Don't use this. Brewtarget automatically calculates hop utilization.</li>
   <li><b>Grain absorption</b> - How many liters of water are permanently lost to each kilogram of grain during
          mashing. The default value is 1.0875 liters per kilogram. This can fluctuate due to the fine-ness of
          your grind, humidity, brand, and other factors.
   <li><b>Boiling Point of Water</b> - The temperature at which water boils. This will vary with altitude. </li>

   <li><b>Volume</b> - The maximum volume your mash tun can hold.</li>
   <li><b>Mass</b> - Mass of your mash tun.</li>
   <li><b>Specific heat</b> - Specific heat of the material of your mash tun in cal/(g*C). Typical values are:</li>
   
   <ul>
      <li>Aluminum - 0.215</li>
      <li>Copper - 0.0924</li>
      <li>Iron/Steel - 0.108</li>
      <li>Plastic - 0.359</li>
   </ul>
   
   <li><b>Kettle to fermenter</b> - How much wort you usually leave behind in the kettle when you transfer the wort to primary.</li>
   <li><b>Lauter deadspace</b> - How much wort you usually lose in the lauter tun.</li>
</ul>

Then, press the diskette button at the bottom to save.
</p>

<h3>Adjusting Recipe Parameters</h3>
<p> From the Equipment drop-down list, choose &quot;5 gal batch - Ideal&quot;
(which assumes 5 gallon batches, 0.75 gal/hr evap. rate, and no losses) 
which is already provided by Brewtarget, just for the sake of demonstration.
You can also drag the &quot;5 gal batch - Ideal&qout; item from the tree on
the left and drop it on the recipe. For now, leave
the efficiency at 70% for the same reason. After selecting or dropping the
equipment or , you will be asked if you want to set the batch and boil size of
the recipe to that of the equipment. Click &quot;Yes&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Brewtarget comes pre-loaded with all of the BJCP styles. This means you can check your recipe against the guidelines
for the particular style you are trying to make. To do this, select &quot; American Amber Ale&quot; from the Style
drop down list. You will notice that the left-most and right-most numbers for OG, FG, ABV, Bitterness, and Color
fields have changed. These reflect the lower and upper bounds of these parameters for the style. The middle number
for each row is the current estimate for your recipe. If the number is blue, it means it is too low; red means too high,
and green means you're in the Goldilocks zone. If you choose, you can create your own styles in the View-&gt;Styles
dialog. You can also view descriptions of the particular style and recommended ingredients there.
</p>

<h3>Adding Ingredients</h3>
<p>
First, go to the Fermentables tab on the main window, and click the blue plus sign on the right.
This brings up the database of fermentables that Brewtarget has. Scroll down to &quot;Pale Malt (2 row) US&quot;,
single-click the name (or anywhere in the row) and press &quot;Add to Recipe&quot;. Repeat for
&quot;Caramel/Crystal Malt - 40L&quot;, and close the fermentable database window.
</p>
<p>
Alternately, you can open the &quot;Fermentable&quot; tree in the left pane,
and drag'n'drop the &quot;Pale Malt (2 row) US&quot;, &quot;Caramel/Crystal Malt - 40L&quot; onto the recipe pane.
<p>
Back at the main window, you will see those two malts in your recipe. Click on the Crystal 40's &quot;Mashed&quot;
checkbox to tell it that we want to have this in the mash (this malt can also be simply steeped).
</p>
<p>
Here's a cool feature about Brewtarget: you can enter amounts of stuff in pretty much any units you want.
Let's see what I mean. Double-click the 2-row's &quot;amount&quot; cell and
enter &quot;3.175 kg&quot;. You will see that it immediately gets converted
into &quot;7.000 lb&quot; if you're using US units. For the crystal 40, tell
it &quot;32 oz&quot; and watch it get converted into &quot;2.000 lb&quot;. You
can change US/English/SI preferences in Tools-&gt;Options. Please see the
section called &quot;Supported Units&quot; in this document to see the correct
abbreviation for each unit.
<b>Important</b>: do not forget that you SHOULD enter the unit suffix (lb, kg,
L, mL, etc.) for almost all amount boxes in brewtarget. If you do not,
brewtarget will simply try to guess what you mean, which can give unexpected
results. In this case, brewtarget will assume that fermentables are entered in
either lbs or kg, depending on how you have configured brewtarget.
</p>
<p>
Now you should notice something different about the OG, FG, etc., displayed in
the main window.  The OG now reads 1.045, and it is green which indicates
&quot;to style&quot; as dictated by the amber ale style we chose. However, the
FG is red, which means it's too high, the ABV is blue which means it is too
low, and the Color number is green: just right. The glass of beer to the right
represents the approximate color of your beer, and the thing right below that
which reads &quot;Cloying&quot; is the maltiness indicator (based on IBU/GU
ratio which now shows 0).  Please note that the maltiness indicator is just a
general guide.
</p>
<p>
Now, go to the Hops tab and add 1 oz Cascade at 1 hr, 1 oz Cascade at 15 min, and 1 oz Cascade at 5 min. The IBUs should
be about 37.6, and in the green. Add Wyeast American Ale yeast to the recipe. Now everything should be in
the green except for the ABV which is about 4.4%, but that's ok (you can correct this if you want by
adding more fermentables).
<b>Note:</b> If you do not provide a unit for the hops (e.g., oz), brewtarget
will assume you are discussing ounces or grams, depending on which units you
have configured brewtarget to use.
</p>
<p>
Like the &quot;Fermentables&quot;, you can also add the hops and the yeast by
opening up the &quot;Hops&quot; or the &quot;Yeast&quot;, respectively, tree in the left pane and 
dragging the ingredients onto the recipe pane and dropping them.
</p>

<h3>Making a Mash</h3>
<p>
Let's do a 2-step mash with a protein rest at 121 F and a conversion rest at 152 F.
</p>
<p>
I should mention something here. Until now, Brewtarget has been <b>lying</b> to you. Underneath the
target batch size on the main window, it says your calculated batch size is 5.000 gal. A similar thing occurs with
the calculated boil size. These are estimates based on your mash and equipment what the actual
volumes will be. Now, since there are no water additions in the &quot;5 gal batch - Ideal&quot; equipment and since we're
not actually adding any water for the mash yet, the displayed volumes should both be 0. However,
Brewtarget uses these calculated batch/boil sizes in the calculation of the OG, IBUs, et cetera. So, brewtarget is
lying because it's convenient
when you haven't set up the mash just to be able to start adding the ingredients
and get an approximate answer. After setting the mash addition volumes, you will get a real answer.
</p>
<p>
Click on &quot;Edit Mash&quot; and give it a name. Notice that you can enter the initial grain temp, sparge
temp and initial tun temp here. Entering these as accurately as possible will give you the best chance
to nail your temperatures. To set tun mass and specific heat, you would click &quot;From Equipment&quot;.
You can save this mash profile by pressing &quot;Save Mash&quot; at the bottom of the mash tab. It
will be saved under the name you gave it in the &quot;Edit mash&quot; dialog. You can
recall a mash profile by selecting it in the appropriate drop down box.
From here, there are two ways to create the mash.
</p>

<h3>Method 1: Mash wiz</h3>
<p>
Go to the mash
tab and click the blue plus. Name it &quot;Protein&quot; and click &quot;OK&quot;. Double click its &quot;Temp&quot; cell and
change to &quot;121 F&quot;, and change the &quot;Time&quot; to &quot;20 min&quot;. This means we want
to hit a target temperature of 121 F for 20 minutes. Do the same for a &quot;Conversion&quot; step at &quot;152 F&quot;
for &quot;1 hr&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The mash wiz is for quickly and easily getting the correct mash temperatures and volumes for a single
batch sparge mash.
Click on the
&quot;Mash wiz&quot; button, and give it a mash thickness of 1.25 qt/lb.
The mash wizard just did 3 things for you: calculated infusion volumes, infusion temps, and
gave you a sparge step that will make you hit your pre-boil volume. Now Brewtarget is not lying anymore
about the calculated boil volume and batch size. Pretty cool? You can
see any of the infusion temperatures by selecting the name of the mash step in the table and
pressing the edit button to the right (looks like a pencil and paper), or by moving to brewday mode which
we will see later. Since your equipment and recipe
might change, you should always do the mash wizard after recalling a saved mash profile.
</p>

<h3>Method 2: Mash designer</h3>
<p>
The mash designer is for more advanced users. It can be used to create pretty much any mash schedule
you desire with however many sparges, and at whatever infusion temp or volume you desire. To enter it,
just click the &quot;Mash Des&quot; button. It is not necessary to add all of the steps beforehand
as we did with the mash wiz. A dialog will ask you for
the temperature of the tun before the first infusion, so enter 70 F and continue.
</p>
<p>
We are now looking at the parameters for the first infusion. Enter &quot;Protein&quot; for the name,
leave the type at &quot;Infusion&quot;, enter &quot;121 F&quot; for &quot;Target temp.&quot;, and
&quot;20 min&quot; for the time. Now, you can either move the infusion/decoction amount slider OR
the infusion temp slider. Moving one will cause the other to move so that the combination of
amount and infusion temp causes you to hit 121 F. The upper and lower limits of these sliders
are based on the maximum available space left in the tun (as given by the current equipment), and
the boiling temperature of water. Start the amount slider at the far left. You will see that the
tun fullness meter on the right shows an infusion ratio of 0.11 qt/lb which is far too low. How
do I know it's too low? The total collected wort meter shows -3.444 qt, meaning that the grain
will absorb all of the 3.020 cups and could absorb another 3.444 qt more. So, slowly move the amount
slider until the infusion ratio reaches about 1.25 qt/lb.
</p>
<p>
You should see that the tun is about 37% full, and we have reached 1.326 gal of the 5.75 gal that we
plan to collect pre-boil. Click &quot;Next&quot;. Title this step &quot;Conversion&quot; and set the
target temp to 152 F and the time to 1 hr. Slowly move the temp slider all the way to 212 F. Click
&quot;Next&quot;. Entitle this step &quot;Batch Sparge&quot;. Click the &quot;Batch Sparge&quot;
checkbox, set the target temp to 170 F, and the time to 15 min. You will notice that the tun fullness
has gone down, simulating that you have drained the tun of liquid; this is the purpose of the checkbox.
Move the amount slider slowly to the right until the total collected wort reaches about 5.75 gal.
<b>NOTE</b>: if you exceed the target 5.75 gal, the progress bar will still show 100 percent, so be
careful and pay attention to the text which shows the actual collected wort. Click &quot;Finish&quot;
to return to the main window.
</p>

<h3>Brewday Mode</h3>
<p>
Now that your recipe is all planned, wouldn't it be good to have some instructions on your
brewday? Click the &quot;Brewday&quot; tab at the top of the main window. Click &quot;Generate Instructions&quot;.
It has made all instructions for you and listed them on the left in order.
You can remove, shift up/down, insert, change steps as you see fit to help you be organized
on your brew day.
</p>
<p>
There are 3 timers to help you with
time-critical steps if you click the clock button in the toolbar of the main window.
They are in HH:MM:SS format, and the text box above each
one is what you use to set it. Just enter &quot;1:00:00&quot; and press &quot;set&quot; to set the timer for
1 hour, for example. The &quot;Sound&quot; button allows you to select a sound that will be played when
the timer reaches zero. Brewtarget has provided many default sounds to choose from, or you can
select any other sound file on your computer.
</p>

<h3>Printing the Recipe</h3>
<p>
Print and print preview are available under the &quot;File&quot; menu. There are two printouts
available. One is &quot;Recipe&quot; and the other is &quot;Brewday&quot;. The recipe printout is
all the info related to the recipe you have made. The brewday printout is formatted in an organized
fashion specifically for following when you actually brew the recipe.
</p>

<h3>Saving your work</h3>
<p>
Before you close Brewtarget, be sure to press the diskette at the top in the toolbar,
<b>or you will lose any changes you have made in this session!</b>
</p>

<h2>General Concepts</h2>
<p>
Brewtarget maintains an internal BeerXML database of recipes, ingredients, etc. At program startup,
it reads these files into memory, and all the editing you do occurs in memory until such time that
you decide to press &quot;save&quot; on the main window. At this point, all your changes will be committed to
the BeerXML database on disk.
</p>

<h2>Trees</h2>
<p>
The old recipe dropdown box has been replaced by a tree view in the left pane.
As a rule, double clicking on any item in the tree will open up the
appropriate editor for that item. In the case of recipes, it will open the
recipe in the main window.
</p>

There are 6 entries in the tree:
<ul>
   <li>Recipes - replacing the old drop down box, this tree shows all your
   recipes.  You can drag'n'drop the recipe onto the main
   window and that recipe will be loaded</li>
   <li>Equipment - this shows all your defined kit. You can drag'n'drop a
   piece of equipment onto your recipe which will have the same effect as
   changing the equipment via the dropdown box. </li>
   <li>Fermentables, Hops, Misc and Yeast - these show all of your defined
   fermentables, hops, miscellaneous and yeasts, respectively. Dragging an
   item onto the main window will add that item to the selected
   recipe.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Context menus</h3>
<p>
You can right click almost anywhere in the tree and get a menu of options.
Depending on where you click, the menus will change a bit. If you right click
on a recipe, the first option will be "new recipe". If you right click on a
fermentable, the first option will be "new fermentable". Otherwise, the
available options will be the same.
</p>
<p>
You can select multiple items, right click and then perform an action on the
entire selected list. The only exception is the &quot;Export&quot; function.
Limitations in the BeerXML format makes it very difficult to export both recipes
and anything else at the same time.
</p>

<h3>BrewNotes</h3>
<p>
If you right-click a recipe, you may notice an action called &quot;Brew
It!&quot;. If you select this option, a new entry will be created underneath
the recipe and a new tab will be opened in the main window. This new tab
allows you to record important information about your beer during its creation
(sg, volumes, temperatures, etc.). This should allow the brewer to track
performance over time and adjust their equipment and efficiencies to better
predict what you brew.
</p>
<b>Note:</b> The current list of fields is our initial pass only. If you want
more fields available, open a feature request on source forge

<p>
The values are preloaded based on the recipe as written. As you move through
your brewday, you can record the actual numbers. The calculated values in the
middle of the screen will change based on those inputs.  For example, if you
expected an SG of 1.036 but only got 1.032 the projected OG, ABV and ABV will
all change to reflect the lower SG.
</p>

<p>
There are three main sections on the brewnote tab. 
<ul>
   <li>Preboil is for mash information
      <ul>
         <li>SG - starting gravity</li>
         <li>Volume - the volume of wort that made it into your boil kettle</li>
         <li>Strike Temp - the temperature of your mash after dough in </li>
         <li>Final Temp - the temperature of your mash at the end of the mash </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Postboil is for information after the boil is complete
      <ul>
         <li>OG - original gravity </li>
         <li>Postboil Volume - the volume of wort in the boil kettle after the
         boil</li>
         <li>Volume into fermenter - the volume of wort that actually makes it
         into the fermenter.</li>
         <li>Pitch temp - the temperature of the wort when you pitched the
         yeast</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Postferment is for information after the beer is fermented
      <ul>
         <li>FG - final gravity </li>
         <li>Volume - the volume of beer that actually makes it into your
         bottles or kegs</li>
         <li>Date - the date the beer finished fermenting</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Adding Ingredients to a Recipe</h2>
<h3>Using the editors</h3>
If you are looking for a fermentable with a specific SRM or a yeast from a
specific lab, this approach allows you to sort on any column you want.
<ol>
	<li>Choose the appropriate tab in the main window (Fermentable, Hops,...).</li>
	<li>Click the &quot;add&quot; button in the tab.</li>
	<li>Select any column of the row of the ingredient you wish to add.</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Add to Recipe&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Using drag'n'drop</h3>
This is the lazy way of doing it, as long as you don't mind the default sort
order.
<ol>
   <li> Open the appropriate tree in the left pane. </li>
   <li> Click on the item you wish to add </li>
   <li> Drag it anywhere in the main part of the window </li>
   <li> And drop </li>
   <li> The tabs will change if required. E.g., if you drop a hop onto the
   &quot;Fermentables&quot; tab, the focus will change to the &quot;Hops&quot;
   tab. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Importing Recipes</h2>
<p>
You can import other BeerXML recipes (such as, from Beersmith) by using File-&gt;Import Recipes.
However, you need to be aware that Beersmith does not strictly adhere to XML standards or even
BeerXML itself (!), so you may have some trouble importing recipes from time to time. Brewtarget tries
to maintain strict compatability with both.
</p>

<h2>Exporting Recipes</h2>
<p>
I bet you can figure this one out.
</p>

<h2>Backing Up and Importing Databases</h2>
<p>
For many reasons, you may want to back up all your recipes and ingredients and everything. To do this,
go to File-&gt;&quot;Backup Database&quot; and select an empty directory. Restoring the database is
just as simple. However, be aware that when you restore a database, anything in your current one will
be wiped out.
</p>

<h2>Posting Your Recipe - Recipe to Clipboard</h2>
<p>
This tool is used to make a text version of the recipe so that you may post it online
or whatever else you can do with a text version. To get the text version, Tools-&gt;&quot;Recipe to Clipboard as Text&quot;,
then click paste in a text editor or other paste-able window.
</p>

<h2>Posting Your Recipe - Save to HTML</h2>
<p>
Another way you can share you recipes is to export them to HTML. Use
File-&gt;&quot;Save to HTML&quot;. You can export either the recipe or the
brewday instructions.
</p>

<h2>OG Correction Tool</h2>
<p>
A common problem is that you under or over estimate your efficiency and get a different OG than you
planned for. To correct this in the boil, choose Tools-&gt;&quot;OG Correction Help&quot;. Please note
that this tool makes the assumption that you are not going to add any water post boil.
Just enter the SG, temp of sample, and calibration temp of the hydrometer OR the degrees Plato of the wort
as you read it pre-boil. Then enter the pre-boil volume. Now, click &quot;Calculate&quot; and 3 fields
will populate on the output half of the window. The first shows you the post-boil OG if you do nothing.
The next shows you how much water to add (or boil off if negative) in order to achieve the right OG.
The last shows how much wort you will end up with.
</p>

<h2>Pitch Rate Calculator</h2>
<p>
This tool is located in Tools-&gt;&quot;Pitch Rate Calculator&quot; and helps you to make a starter
that has the correct amount of yeast for your beer. Put in the wort volume, OG and starter OG (in specific gravity)
and select the pitch rate. The pitch rate should be 0.75-1.00 for most ales and 1.50-2.00 for lagers.
The output is the number of yeast cells required (in billions), the number of wyeast activator packs or
white labs vials needed without a starter, the amount of dry yeast required (without starter), and the
size of the starter needed to reach the cell count at the given starter OG (usually never over 1.030).
</p>

<h2>Priming Calculator</h2>
<p>
Tools-&gt;&quot;Priming Calculator&quot;. Put in the required input values, select a priming agent, and
press calculate.
</p>

<h2>Refractometer Tools</h2>
<p>
Tools-&gt;&quot;Refractometer Tools&quot;. Here, you can find OG and current SG by using refractometer
readings. You must always enter the current plato and either the original plato OR the OG. If you just
want to find out what 11.2 Plato corresponds to, enter 11.2 in both the original plato and current plato
fields.
</p>

<h2>Units</h2>
	<p>
	Brewtarget supports SI, Imperial, and US customary units.
	To switch between these modes, go to tools-&gt;options, and check/uncheck the appropriate box.
	It also supports a cool feature I call <b>auto-conversion</b>. For example, if you are in US mode, and you enter
	&quot;0.50 gal&quot; into a text field, it will appear as &quot;2.000 qt&quot;. You may also enter units from the other
	unit system if you like. However, if you enter an unsupported unit, Brewtarget will assume the quantity you entered
	has the same units as the BeerXML entry for that field (which is usuall SI). For example, if you enter &quot;20 asdf&quot;
	into a volume field while in US mode, you will see &quot;5.283 gal&quot; because Brewtarget assumed you meant &quot;20 L&quot;
	and then converted to US units. In other words, always use a valid unit suffix.
	</p>
	<h3>Caveats with Auto-conversion</h3>
	<p>
	With US and Imperial units, people have a tendency to sometimes put a trailing &quot;s&quot; or a period at the end (hrs, hrs., etc.).
	Brewtarget only supports singular no-period units. This is a common error among users since the habit is
	so ingrained. The reason for this lack of support for such spellings should be obvious...it would mean the program has
	to guess what you mean. The units supported, and the exact unit abbreviation you should use are given below.
	</p>
	<h3>Supported Units</h3>
		<h4>US Customary Units</h4>
