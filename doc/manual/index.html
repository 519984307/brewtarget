<h1>Brewtarget 1.0b Manual</h1>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
Be aware that this is a beta version. You may experience crashing or weird behavior, so
please press "save" often.
</p>

<h2>General Concepts</h2>
<p>
Brewtarget maintains an internal BeerXML database of recipes, ingredients, etc. At program startup,
it reads these files into memory, and all the editing you do occurs in memory until such time that
you decide to press "save" on the main window. At this point, all your changes will be committed to
the BeerXML database on disk.
</p>

<h2>Adding Ingredients to a Recipe</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Choose the appropriate tab in the main window (Fermentable, Hops,...).</li>
	<li>Click the &quot;add&quot; button in the tab.</li>
	<li>Select any column of the row of the ingredient you wish to add.</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Add to Recipe&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Importing Recipes</h2>
<p>
You can import other BeerXML recipes (such as, from Beersmith) by using File->Import Recipes.
However, you need to be aware that Beersmith does not strictly adhere to XML standards or even
BeerXML, so you may have some trouble importing recipes from time to time. Brewtarget tries
to maintain strict compatability with both.
</p>

<h2>Exporting Recipes</h2>
<p>
I bet you can figure this one out.
</p>

<h2>Units</h2>
	<p>
	Brewtarget supports both metric and US customary units (sometimes incorrectly called English units or Imperial units).
	To switch between these modes, go to tools->options, and check/uncheck the appropriate box.
	It also supports a cool feature I call <b>auto-conversion</b>. For example, if you are in US mode, and you enter
	&quot;0.50 gal&quot; into a text field, it will appear as &quot;2.000 qt&quot;. You may also enter units from the other
	unit system if you like. However, if you enter an unsupported unit, Brewtarget will assume the quantity you entered
	has the same units as the BeerXML entry for that field (which is in metric). For example, if you enter &quot;20 asdf&quot;
	into a volume field while in US mode, you will see &quot;5.283 gal&quot; because Brewtarget assumed you meant &quot;20 L&quot;
	and then converted to US units.
	</p>
	<h3>Caveats with Auto-conversion</h3>
	<p>
	With US units, people have a tendency to sometimes put a trailing &quot;s&quot; or a period at the end (hrs, hrs., etc.).
	Brewtarget only supports singular no-period units. This will probably be a common error among users since the habit is
	so ingrained. The reason for this lack of support for such spellings should be obvious...it would mean the program has
	to guess what you mean. The units supported, and the exact unit abbreviation you should use are given below.
	</p>
